 new_wave_confucianism_desc:0 "As the Chinese People's Republic collaapsed during The Event, old ideas and traditions began to reasert themselves once again even as modern ideas stubbornly  refused to die. Amidst the chaos, the people looked for one who might be in posession of the mandate of heaven. In the nearly three centuries before the establishment of the Federal Republic dozens of warlords made a play at re-establishing dynastic rule in China, and it was under the protection one such now forgotten warlord that the Church of All Under Heaven was established. An attempt to create an organized ecclesiastical structure to prop up his own rule, the organization has long outlived him and taken upon a life of its own. Despite being commonly known as Old Confucians, the Church of All Under Heaven bases it's teachings upon those of the New Text Confucians, interpreting confucian ideas through a more overtly mystical and esoteric lens. Though originally surpressed by the Federal Government, in the centuries since China's unification it has (mostly) made peace with the overarching republican structure of the country. Nevertheless, it remains more popular in the interior of the Federation where fedualism holds a greater sway and north of the Yellow River, where Federal control is either loose or completely absent."

As a major hub of New Confucian thought before The Event, the island's comparative peace allowed a large portion of New Confucian works to survive the centuries. Originating early in the last  century before the Event, New Confucian thinkers sought to adapt the ancient Confucian intellectual tradition to modern republican political structures. With its emphasis that a truely virtuous great sage must value what is best among all peoples and religions and be willing to abdicate rule to those superior to himself, New Confucian thought has undergone a renisance in the Federal Republic of China and currently serves as the the closest thing to the offical ideology of the state."

Those texts, however, have come to be understood less as an accurate description of our people before the event and more metaphorically: a paradise on earth, described by the legendary four principled philosophers, Xiǎopíng, Zemin, Liè and Zedong. They expand Taoist ideas of self-development and actualisation through methods of "opening up", "seeking truth from facts" and "self struggle", coming to the twelve core social values of Xí (habit), with the first among equals being prosperity. This follows from the original pre-event philosopher Xiǎopíng and his core philosophy: 致富 (seek wealth). Their teachings are thought to be the pillars upon which Heaven stood and which would lead the Chinese people to paradise and it is up to us to follow their Selected Works by the letter."

It isn't clear where they are from or why they haven't docked yet, but they are unlike any vessel from the Americas. \n\nThe tales are disturbing the peace in our empire, but it does spark curiousity.
