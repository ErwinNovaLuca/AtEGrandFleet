Those texts, however, have come to be understood less as an accurate description of our people before the event and more metaphorically: a paradise on earth, described by the legendary four principled philosophers, Xiǎopíng, Zemin, Liè and Zedong. They expand Taoist ideas of self-development and actualisation through methods of "opening up", "seeking truth from facts" and "self struggle", coming to the twelve core social values of Xí (habit), with the first among equals being prosperity. This follows from the original pre-event philosopher Xiǎopíng and his core philosophy: 致富 (seek wealth). Their teachings are thought to be the pillars upon which Heaven stood and which would lead the Chinese people to paradise and it is up to us to follow their Selected Works by the letter."

Supposedly, Cascadian fishermen spread these tales on the docks of San Francisco. \n\nTheir claims compare this foreign fleet to those of Old America: wooden ships with enormous sails gliding on the horizon, but staying at a distance. It isn't clear where they are from or why they haven't docked yet, but they are unlike any vessel from the Americas. \n\nThe tales are disturbing the peace in our empire, but it does spark curiousity. Is the world bigger than we think it is? Are there civilized lands across the great Pacific?"
