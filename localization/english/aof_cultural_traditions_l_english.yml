 han_buddhism_desc:0 "Following from a long history of Buddhist practices that came to China during the Han dynasty, Han Buddhism has become an uniquely Chinese school of Buddhist practice, influenced by local folk religions, Confucianism, Taoism and other worldly philosophies. While it contains a variety of schools with different doctrines, Han Buddhism is far less sectarian, with different schools lending different doctrines from eachother. This acceptance of other beliefs can also be found in its syncretic relationship with China's other religions, with many Han Buddhists practicing Buddhism and a second system of belief, most often local folk religions."

 new_wave_confucianism_desc:0 "As the Chinese People's Republic collaapsed during The Event, old ideas and traditions began to reasert themselves once again even as modern ideas stubbornly  refused to die. Amidst the chaos, the people looked for one who might be in posession of the mandate of heaven. In the nearly three centuries before the establishment of the Federal Republic dozens of warlords made a play at re-establishing dynastic rule in China, and it was under the protection one such now forgotten warlord that the Church of All Under Heaven was established. An attempt to create an organized ecclesiastical structure to prop up his own rule, the organization has long outlived him and taken upon a life of its own. Despite being commonly known as Old Confucians, the Church of All Under Heaven bases it's teachings upon those of the New Text Confucians, interpreting confucian ideas through a more overtly mystical and esoteric lens. Though originally surpressed by the Federal Government, in the centuries since China's unification it has (mostly) made peace with the overarching republican structure of the country. Nevertheless, it remains more popular in the interior of the Federation where fedualism holds a greater sway and north of the Yellow River, where Federal control is either loose or completely absent."

As a major hub of New Confucian thought before The Event, the island's comparative peace allowed a large portion of New Confucian works to survive the centuries. Originating early in the last  century before the Event, New Confucian thinkers sought to adapt the ancient Confucian intellectual tradition to modern republican political structures. With its emphasis that a truely virtuous great sage must value what is best among all peoples and religions and be willing to abdicate rule to those superior to himself, New Confucian thought has undergone a renisance in the Federal Republic of China and currently serves as the the closest thing to the offical ideology of the state."

They expand Taoist ideas of self-development and actualisation through methods of "opening up", "seeking truth from facts" and "self struggle", coming to the twelve core social values of Xí (habit), with the first among equals being prosperity. This follows from the original pre-event philosopher Xiǎopíng and his core philosophy: 致富 (seek wealth). Their teachings are thought to be the pillars upon which Heaven stood and which would lead the Chinese people to paradise and it is up to us to follow their Selected Works by the letter."

 treasure_fleet.0001.desc:0 "The West Coast has been uproar for weeks at this point, as rumours of a #"Grand Fleet#" of foreign men have spread from the North. Supposedly, Cascadian fishermen spread these tales on the docks of San Francisco. \n\nTheir claims compare this foreign fleet to those of Old America: wooden ships with enormous sails gliding on the horizon, but staying at a distance. It isn't clear where they are from or why they haven't docked yet, but they are unlike any vessel from the Americas. \n\nThe tales are disturbing the peace in our empire, but it does spark curiousity. Is the world bigger than we think it is? Are there civilized lands across the great Pacific?"
 treasure_fleet.0001.a:0 "Is there something beyond the Western horizon?"
 treasure_fleet.0001.b:0 "Unknown foreigners on big ships?"

 treasure_fleet.0002.t:0 "First Contact"
 treasure_fleet.0002.desc:0 "They came from across the horizon, their big ships drifting looming not far from our shores. The fleet is a awe inspiring sight to behold, far larger than anything anyone now alive in these lands has seen. As the town and court alike have stopped all other work for the day to gawk at the novelty, a much smaller boat seperates from the fleet, and a man on the boat waves a large white flag of truce. \n\nOne among them, a scholar by the looks of him, speaks to our court's officals waiting for the boat at the docks. Astonisingly, he speaks the archaic old English of the United States well enough for one of our own scholars to communicate with him in the language. Our translator tells us that the fleet comes from a state called The Federal Republic of China that lies on the other side of the Pacific. Their fleet has come here to re-establish diplomatic ties and trade with the peoples of the Americas. The Admiral of their fleet would like to request a formal audience with the authority of these lands."

Ships with designs that are completely alien to the Pacific Coast have been spotted from the Golden Gate. They are quickly approaching the bay and thus California's heartland and a question will soon need an answer: are these ships run by merchants or are they warships? \n\nFor now, that answer cannot be questioned from such a distance. San Francisco's leaders have, however, demanded a decision from the Lieutenant. We cannot wait too long, as preparation will be needed in the case of conflict."

 treasure_fleet.2001.desc:0 "The contact between the New and Old World has not just brought new goods, customs and people to the Americas, but also new information of the outside world. New World Buddhism has been shaken by Chinese merchants and Tibetan Buddhists who confirm the existance of a Dalai Lama, who the Lamaists consider their unifying head of faith. \n\nThe concept of a Dalai Lama has shaken Shangrilaists everywhere, as the confirmation of the existance of mythical Thibet and the Dalai Lama as its head creates awkward questions. If the people of Tibet follow the word of the Dalai Lama, should Shangrilists do the same? Is it okay to maintain our system of doctrines that is based on our own, special needs or would we be heretical? Some even question the very existance of this Dalai Lama: couldn't this just be a trick by foreigners?"
 treasure_fleet.2001.a:0 "We reject the notion of the Dalai Lama actually existing"

Despite the hardship, we found ourselves a new home on a new continent, carving out a little piece to act as a sanctuary from persecution, repression and intolerance. \n\nThe future looks bright upon this new Tibet, which may now act as an Utopian Beyul: a safehaven for all Buddhists who are still spat out by foreign powers. Peace will reign in these valleys."
